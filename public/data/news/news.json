        "content": "With a market cap of $2.43 trillion, Apple (AAPL) is the world\u2019s biggest company - the giant amongst giants. While most on the Street foresee more growth on the horizon, one analyst has just taken expectations to the next level.\n\nTigress' Ivan Feinseth has just reiterated a Strong Buy rating for the tech behemoth and attached a Street-high price target of $198. The implication for investors? Upside of 35% from current levels. (To watch Feinseth\u2019s track record, click here)\n\nThe 5-star analyst counts \u201cstrong product demand, new product introductions, and accelerating Services revenue\u201d as the basis for his bullish take, all which will \u201ccontinue to drive significant revenue and Economic Profit growth.\u201d\n\nIf it\u2019s product and innovation you\u2019re after, then you might as well head straight to the iPhone - or more specifically, the iPhone 13, to be launched this Friday (Sep 24).\n\n\u201cFor relatively the same price points as comparable iPhone 12 models,\u201d says the 5-star analyst, \u201cThe new iPhone 13 models give consumers higher resolution cameras and screens, faster processors, increased functionality, more storage, and longer battery life.\u201d Apple appears confident its latest model is destined for success. Earlier this month, the company instructed its suppliers to up the iPhone production\u2019s initial run rate to 90 million units, a 20% increase on the initial 75 million unit runway of the iPhone 12.\n\nThe new model was unveiled at the recent California Streaming event, where the company also introduced the Apple Watch Series 7 and a new iPad and iPad mini.\n\nEach new product introduced provides \u201csignificant value, increased functionality, and 5G high-speed connectivity to continue driving the current upgrade supercycle,\u201d say Feinseth. All contribute toward further growing Apple\u2019s constantly expanding ecosystem and add to the \u201chighly profitable and fast-growing Services revenues.\u201d\n\nTalking of the Services segment, here Apple \u201ccontinues to make strategic acquisitions to enhance its Services offerings and product portfolio.\u201d\n\nStory continues\n\nLast year, the company added Canadian payment startup Mobeewave to its roster, an acquisition which has allowed Apple to turn the iPhone into a portable payment terminal and which further enhances the company\u2019s mobile payment and financial services capabilities. Broadcast platform creator Subverse also came onboard last year and further adding to its \u201cmedia creation and distribution capabilities,\u201d so has \u201cvirtual reality theme park experience creator\u201d Spaces. Furthermore, to handle enterprise-based software upgrades, Apple has also acquired software company Fleetsmith.\n\nTo top it all off, there is a mighty balance sheet boasting $177.49 billion \u2013 or $10.67 per share - in excess cash which in addition to the estimated $163.81 billion in Economic Operating Cash Flow (EBITDAR) the company is expected to generate over the next 12 months, will allow for the \u201ccontinued funding of new growth initiatives and strategic acquisitions while returning significant amounts of cash to shareholders.\u201d\n\nSo, that\u2019s Tigress\u2019 bullish view, but what does the rest of the Street make of Apple\u2019s prospects? Based on 19 Buys vs. 6 Holds, the stock has a Strong Buy consensus rating. While the average price target is not quite as high as Feinseth\u2019s, at $169.64, the figure is expected to reward investors with 15.5% returns in the year ahead.

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Patents originally owned by the bankrupt Silicon Valley darling Jawbone Inc. are at the center of new lawsuits seeking royalties from Alphabet Inc.\u2019s Google and Apple Inc. over noise canceling technology in their ear buds, smartphones and smart home devices.\n\nJawbone Innovations LLC, the current owner of the patents, filed the suits Tuesday in federal court in Waco, Texas, a district that\u2019s the most popular in the nation for its patent-friendly judge and juries.\n\nJawbone Inc. was considered a pioneer in wearable technology but it lost the market to Fitbit Inc. A bare-knuckle legal battle between the two left Jawbone mortally wounded before the companies settled their fight in 2017. Jawbone ended up liquidating its assets, while Fitbit was bought by Google for $2.1 billion earlier this year.\n\nGoogle, Apple and other companies each had a chance to buy the assets of the bankrupt company and passed, according to the complaints. It\u2019s unclear from the suits and Patent and Trademark Office filings who\u2019s behind the company that now owns the patents. Jawbone Innovations is headquartered in a small office building in Waco with no phone number and the lawyers on the case couldn\u2019t immediately be reached.\n\n\u201cWe dispute the claims, and will defend ourselves vigorously,\u201d Jos\u00e9 Casta\u00f1eda, a Google spokesperson, said in response to the suits.\n\nOfficials with Apple had no immediate comment.\n\nThe eight patents in the case relate to ways to limit background noise in devices, technology that was developed in Jawbone\u2019s early years, when it was contracted by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency to research noise suppression techniques for the U.S. military, according to the complaints.\n\nSamsung Electronics Co., another company said to have passed on buying Jawbone\u2019s assets, was sued by Jawbone Innovations in May over two of the noise-canceling patents. That case is pending in federal court in Marshall, Texas, which also is known as a patent-friendly venue.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe new cases are Jawbone Innovations LLC v Google LLC, 21-985, and Jawbone Innovations LLC v. Apple Inc., 21-984, both U.S. District Court for the Western District of Texas (Waco).\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nEvergrande Debt Crisis Is Financial Stress Test No One Wanted A Tiny Piece of Plastic Is Helping Farmers Use Far Less Water Microsoft and an Army of Tiny Telecoms Are Part of a Plan to Wire Rural America In Amazon\u2019s Flagship Fulfillment Center, the Machines Run the Show The Energy Future Needs Cleaner Batteries\n\n\u00a92021 Bloomberg L.P.",

        "content": "Facebook, Inc. (NASDAQ: FB) informed advertisers Wednesday that changes Apple, Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL) made to its iOS operating system are negatively impacting ad performance in the third quarter. However, Bank of America analyst Justin Post says the 4% sell-off in Facebook\u2019s stock is an overreaction to the news.\n\nThe Changes: Facebook also said in its blog post the iOS changes have also led to the company underreporting iOS web conversions by about 15%, which has made the negative impact of the changes appear far worse to advertisers than they really are.\n\nApple\u2019s so-called identifiers for advertisers (IDFA), are unique device identifiers that allow Facebook and others to target ads to users and estimate their effectiveness. Apple iPhone and iPad users are now given the option to opt-in to IDFA tracking when they first launch an app.\n\nFacebook gave advertisers some tips for dealing with the changes and said the company is optimistic it can eventually work through privacy headwinds.\n\nRelated Link: Why Twitter And TikTok Were Big Social Media Winners In Q2\n\nFinancial Impact: Post said the blog post makes clear the ADFA changes are a real problem for Facebook. In fact, he said the uncertainty will likely weigh on Facebook stock at least until third-quarter earnings, which now appear unlikely to exceed current analyst expectations.\n\nFortunately, Facebook chose not to cut its guidance in the blog post, although Post said market expectations may now be lower for the third quarter. In the longer term, he said privacy chances could ultimately benefit online media platforms like Facebook and Alphabet, Inc. (NASDAQ GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) subsidiary YouTube, which are both ramping up in-app shopping.\n\n\u201cAs usual with disruptions, such as GDPR or advertiser boycotts, we would expect backfill in Facebook\u2019s ad auction (by brand advertisers in this case), and then the impact to fade as platforms adopt strategies to increase opt-in rates, build products for in-app activity (such as shopping capabilities), and adopt new targeting and measurement capabilities,\u201d Post said.\n\nStory continues\n\nBank of America has a Buy rating and $425 price target for Facebook.\n\nBenzinga\u2019s Take: The market hates uncertainty more than anything else. Unless Facebook provides another update on the situation at some point, upside or the stock may be limited until Facebook\u2019s third-quarter earnings report expected out in early November.\n\nLatest Ratings for FB\n\nSep 2021 Jefferies Maintains Buy Sep 2021 Goldman Sachs Initiates Coverage On Buy Sep 2021 HSBC Maintains Reduce\n\nView More Analyst Ratings for FB\r\nView the Latest Analyst Ratings\n\nSee more from Benzinga\n\nClick here for options trades from Benzinga Is Amazon's Stock Overvalued Or Undervalued?

It has four variations \u2014 the iPhone 13 mini, the iPhone 13, the iPhone 13 Pro, and the iPhone 13 Pro Max.\n\nThe new phones will retail from \u00a3679 in the UK and $699 in the US. The iPhone Pro Max with one terabyte of storage will be the most expensive iPhone ever, retailing at \u00a31,549 in the UK and $1,099 in the US.\n\nThey vary in size but are not hugely different from the iPhone 12 in terms of looks. One difference is that the notch at the top has been shrunk by 20%, meaning the screen is bigger. The orientation of the rear cameras is also different on some of the new models.\n\nUsers that might be looking for better camera specs will notice the new phones gather 47% more light and now includes night mode. The iPhone 13's ultra-wide angle camera and wide-angle lenses captures betters shots in dim settings. Cinematic mode on iPhone records videos with a beautiful depth effect with automatic focus changes, Apple said. Photo: Apple\n\nAccording to Yahoo Finance's iPhone 13 launch review Apple,Samsung and Google (GOOGL) \"have similarly made the cameras on their smartphones a centrepiece of marketing... But Apple is clearly trying to make the case that it and it alone is the best when it comes to making smartphone cameras that can make high-end standalone cameras obsolete. It even ran an ad during its unveiling that essentially said as much.\"\n\n\u201cThe new pro camera system offers even more pro photography capabilities like improved telephoto zoom, macro photography, Photographic Styles, Cinematic mode, as well as ProRes and Dolby Vision video,\" said Greg Joswiak, Apple\u2019s senior vice president of worldwide marketing.\n\nThe company said its cinematic mode comes with automatic focus changes, \"so anyone can capture cinema-style moments, even if they aren\u2019t a professional filmmaker.\"\n\nRead more: Which iPhone 13 should you buy?\n\nAnd its Super Retina XDR display with ProMotion \"intelligently responds\" to the content on the screen, making it \"perfect for any viewing experience.\u201d\n\nStory continues The iPhone 13 and iPhone 13 mini. Photo: Apple\n\nSpeaking of the iPhone 13 and the mini, Joswiak said: \"Both phones have beautiful designs, industry-leading performance, and advanced camera systems with impressive computational photography features, all with incredible durability, water resistance, and a big jump in battery life to ensure customers can depend on their iPhone when they need it.\"\n\nThe mini is expected to get an hour and a half more battery on a full charge, while the iPhone 13 gets two and a half more hours.\n\nThe Pro range include 5G compatibility, a new storage capacity of 1 terabyte, and a ceramic shield front cover, which Apple said is \u201ctougher than any smartphone glass.\u201d Apple stock over the last year. Chart: Yahoo Finance UK\n\nThey are are available in graphite, gold, silver, and a new colour called sierra blue.\n\nMeanwhile the iPhone 13 and iPhone 13 mini come in five colours - pink, blue, midnight, starlight, and (PRODUCT)RED \u2014 every (PRODUCT)RED purchase contributes to Apple's Global Fund to combat pandemics like COVID\u201119 and AIDS.\n\nThe \u200ciPhone 12\u200c lineup passed 100 million sales in April this year, within seven months of its launch. The milestone was achieved two months faster than the iPhone 11 series that launched in 2019.\n\nThe company, whose stock was up 0.6% on Thursday afternoon to trade at $147, has also come out with a new Apple Watch and a new version of its iPad and iPad mini.\n\nThe new watch gets a 20% larger display and a slightly larger body.

In 2013, she was named executive vice president at Louis Vuitton, her current role.\r\nLeadership Advice: \u201cI am very honored and humbled to be on this list alongside women who are real drivers and agents of change in our industry. Even if leadership is genderless, we all have a responsibility to inspire and empower future generations. At LVMH, we created several initiatives to support women in attaining high positions within the group. I am particularly proud of our performance at Louis Vuitton where women hold close to 50 percent of top leadership roles.\u201d\n\nStory continues\n\n2. Drew Barrymore\r\n Founder, Barrymore Brands\n\nPower Move: Drew Barrymore is so adept at creating a true connection with anyone in her orbit, it\u2019s easy to forget she\u2019s a global superstar whose business interests span the worlds of Hollywood, home, fashion, beauty and, most recently, media \u2014 a hit TV show now in its second season and a magazine that launched last year. Her brand is called Flower and no wonder \u2014 Barrymore is in full blossom.\r\nLeadership Advice: \u201cIf you care about the word power, you better be diligent and take the ego out of it because there\u2019s no room for ego in business and working with other people. It\u2019s alienating and unnecessary. Work from your heart, work from your gut \u2014 much better place.\u201d\n\n3. Francesca Bellettini\r\n President and Chief Executive Officer, Yves Saint Laurent\n\nPower Move: Francesca Bellettini began as an investment banker before moving to the Prada group in 1999.

In 2013, she became president and chief executive officer of Yves Saint Laurent.\r\nLeadership Advice: \u201cLeadership is not a title. It does not appear in an organizational chart and cannot come without the respect of others and yourself. A leader must have the ability to decide and guide while avoiding paralyzing others due to the fear of the risks that any decision bears. A leader is aware of the risks but does not let them weaken if they are reasonable to take. And most importantly, the leader is the one who encourages people to work better by identifying and building on their strengths and keeping them moving in the right direction.\u201d\n\n4. Sabina Belli \r\n Chief Executive Officer, Pomellato\n\nPower Move: Sabina Belli joined Kering, which controls Pomellato, in April 2015 as general manager of the Italian jewelry brand and at the end of that year was promoted to chief executive officer.

She joined Kering, which controls Pomellato, in April 2015 as general manager of the brand and at the end of that year was promoted to CEO. Belli has long been vocal about empowering women, launching for example the Pomellato For Women campaign in 2017, promoting female leadership. She was instrumental in founding the #PomellatoForWomen platform in 2017 with ambassadors including Jane Fonda and Cate Blanchett, promoting equality and inclusivity, and Belli spearheaded an awareness campaign and crowdfunding initiative to support women victims of domestic violence. The company has for more than a decade supported CADMI, an antiviolence center in Milan, and its parent network D.i.Re.\r\nLeadership Advice:\u201cAs a CEO, female empowerment is a strong value for me. Gender or diversity should not be a problem at work and beyond. I encourage and strive to provide equality and equal career opportunities for my employees. As leaders we need to pursue a higher purpose, to create a common vision that moves people to achieve big dreams, to improve the world we live in. As leaders we have to foster hope.\u201d\n\n5. Roberta Benaglia\r\n Founder and CEO, Style Capital\n\nPower Move: Roberta Benaglia has built a solid reputation as a thoroughly prepared and fearless investor. In Milan, she founded Style Capital, the fund that acquired a 32 percent stake in MSGM in 2018, supporting the brand\u2019s founder Massimo Giorgetti, forging distribution partnerships and building a global retail network. Last year, Style Capital became in investor in Australian brand Zimmermann, expanding the fund\u2019s portfolio of investments in the fashion industry, which also includes Forte_Forte and Los Angeles-based company Re\/Done. Benaglia is also associated with the success of Golden Goose. Style Capital, which at that time was named DGPA, acquired 38 percent of the luxury sneaker brand in March 2013 and sold it in 2015. During that time, under the lead of Style Capital, Golden Goose\u2019s revenues increased from 21.4 million euros to 76 million euros. In 2015, Golden Goose passed under the control of Ergon Capital Partners III and in 2017 was acquired by Carlyle Europe Partners IV, which last February sold the brand to Permira for 1.2 billion euros.\n\n6. Esi Eggleston Bracey\r\n Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer, Beauty and Personal Care, Unilever North America\n\nPower Move: Over the course of her career, Esi Eggleston Bracey has prioritized purpose as much as profit \u2014 and with oversight of Unilever\u2019s beauty and personal care businesses in North America, she\u2019s got one of the largest platforms out there. Whether helping to pass antihair discrimination with The Crown Act or overseeing the creation of sustainable brands like Love Beauty and Planet, Bracey has driven impact across all areas of her business.\r\nLeadership Advice: \u201cInvest in yourself and your personal development. Understand how to bring your authentic self to help inspire, focus, and empower people to embrace your leadership mission.\u201d\n\n7. Tory Burch\n\nExecutive Chairman and Chief Creative Director, Tory Burch\n\nPower Move: Tory Burch draws inspiration from the worlds of travel, art and interiors and women globally. She has successfully steered her designer lifestyle brand that today does well over $1.5 billion in sales, according to sources. The brand encompasses ready-to-wear, handbags, footwear, accessories, jewelry, home and beauty and empowers women through the Tory Burch Foundation, which advances women\u2019s empowerment and entrepreneurship in the U.S. by providing access to capital, education and digital resources. Burch is known as a creative and entrepreneurial leader who encourages everyone to shine in a highly collaborative environment.\n\nLeadership Advice: \u201cI always tell the entrepreneurs I work with through our Foundation to think about the leaders they have known and the qualities that brought out the best in them. For me, it comes down to the values passed down by my parents and the lessons I have learned throughout my career. When you create a strong and inclusive culture where people are treated with kindness and respect, they do great work. As importantly, they stay with you. There are members of my team who have been with me from the beginning when we were working around my kitchen table. Leaders by definition inspire followers.\u201d\n\n8. Anne Cavassa\r\n President, Saucony\n\nPower Move: Lifted by the running boom, Saucony is racking up product wins \u2014 and under Anne Cavassa\u2019s leadership achieved an all-time revenue high in the second quarter.\r\nLeadership Advice: \u201cWe have to be nimble and agile, but also very thoughtful and deliberate. What we\u2019ve been doing is rallying around our brand purpose. As a leader, I think it\u2019s been really important to me that my actions are in alignment with both our mission statement as well as my own core values.\u201d\n\n9. Emma Chamberlain\r\n Creative Director and Global Brand Ambassador, Bad Habit\n\nPower Move: YouTube sensation Emma Chamberlain has become a fashion-world favorite (and beauty, too.) Most recently, she made her debut at the Met Ball, dressed in custom Louis Vuitton, a brand she has worked with since 2019. She\u2019s also found success with her Chamberlain Coffee, as well as Bad Habit skin care, for whom she serves as global ambassador and creative director. And with nearly 14 million Instagram followers and over 1 billion views on YouTube, her influence shows no signs of waning.\r\nLeadership Advice: \u201cPrioritize creativity and passion over everything. I constantly ask myself, am I creatively inspired? Why am I creating? Am I proud of what I am doing? If the answer is ever no to one of those questions, that means I am creating for the wrong reasons, or I have gotten too caught up in \u2018grind culture.\u2019 You must enjoy the process of creating in order to create things that will reach people\u2019s hearts, while simultaneously enhancing your own life. Many people (myself included) forget that we decide how we want to live our lives every day, and if we want to shift things around and step outside of the box to keep ourselves creatively inspired, we can do that.\u201d\n\n10. Eva Chen\r\nVice President of Fashion and Shopping Partnerships, Instagram\n\nPower Move: Eva Chen spent seven years at Teen Vogue and earned her degree in journalism from Columbia University. In 2013, she became editor in chief of Lucky.

Angelica Cheung\r\n Venture Partner, Sequoia Capital China\n\nPower Move: Vogue does not define Angelica Cheung. The former longtime editorial director of Vogue China who launched and spearheaded the fashion title\u2019s Chinese edition for 16 years is now a venture partner at Sequoia Capital\u2019s China branch, a strategic adviser for Ermenegildo Zegna to chief executive officer Gildo Zegna for the Asian region, and a board member of luxury e-retailer Ssense. Cheung is now utilizing her insight into the Chinese market to scout and support a new generation of Chinese innovation and international brands in the fashion, lifestyle and entertainment sectors to expand in the market.\n\n12. Maria Grazia Chiuri\r\n Creative Director, Dior\n\nPower Move: Maria Grazia Chiuri has implemented messages of female empowerment into Christian Dior through romantic and artisanal craftsmanship. From the start, she emblazoned T-shirts and decorated runway show sets with powerful slogans to push the message, while upholding the brand\u2019s ongoing popularity through the omnipresent Christian Dior handbags.\r\nLeadership Advice: \u201cIt\u2019s such an honor to have been included in this extraordinary group of women. I\u2019m conscious of the responsibility it brings. I believe that, today more than ever, it is essential that women stop setting limits on their goals. We need to get over all our shyness and our fears. We need to get over our feeling of not being enough, which has held us back for years. The challenges we face today to achieve a future that is sustainable in all ways are numerous and critical. Women who were raised to be caretakers must understand that the time has arrived for us to be a united, active group, and we each need to welcome the honor of being a leader in our respective camps.\u201d\n\n13. Sharon Chuter\r\n Founder and CEO, Uoma Beauty; Founder, Pull Up for Change\n\nPower Move: When Sharon Chuter launched her makeup brand, Uoma Beauty, in 2019, her goal was to create a truly inclusive line that transcended foundation shades. After the murder of George Floyd at the hands of Minneapolis police, Chuter not only doubled down on her original mission, she catalyzed the beauty industry with the creation of Pull Up for Change, challenging companies to share their stats on diversity, equity and inclusivity and set clear goals for change. Chuter may be relatively new to beauty, but her impact belies her years.\r\nLeadership Advice: \u201cTrust in yourself especially in your \u2018femininity.\u2019 Lead with tenacity but also lead with empathy if that\u2019s who you are naturally. Don\u2019t feel the need to do things the way men do it or have done it. This is the gift of diversity. There is no right or wrong way so do it your way. Also remember that it\u2019s OK to make mistakes and when you do, don\u2019t beat yourself up too much \u2014 women tend to expect perfection from ourselves and that holds us back. Perfection is not the goal \u2014 just try, just start. Fail fast and fail forward.\u201d\n\n14. CaSandra Diggs\n\nPresident, The Council of Fashion Designers of America\n\nPower Move: CaSandra Diggs was appointed president of the CFDA in August 2020 from chief administrative and financial officer, charged with developing strategy and making decisions that further the CFDA\u2019s purpose to champion, educate and support its members and the fashion industry. She is an innovative thinker with a strong understanding of organizational and business operations, and the expansion of her role provided the CFDA with more opportunities to meet the needs of its members in a broad and diverse way.\n\nLeadership Advice: \u201cLet the E.G.O. you lead from always be Empathy, Gratitude and Optimism so that you consistently support, appreciate and inspire the people that follow you.\u201d\n\n15.

Dogan has been with Amazon for 14 years leading category, technology and operations teams, joining in 2007 to build revenue management science models for their advertising business.\r\nLeadership Advice: \u201cWe\u2019re focused on creating the future of shopping by merging the worlds of fashion and technology, and I encourage working backward from the customer and inventing for their latent needs. I find the team\u2019s full potential is reached when a culture of unconstrained, out-of-the-box ideation is fostered. I also encourage an environment where every team member feels empowered to present a new idea or a different way of remedying customer challenges. We all have seats at the table.\u201d\n\n16.Chiara Ferragni\n\nEntrepreneur, Brand Ambassador, Influencer\n\nPower Move: Chiara Ferragni has full control of TBS Crew Srl, the company that manages The Blonde Salad online magazine and activities.

She has been expanding her product offer, launching her first total look collection under her namesake brand for fall 2021, underwear and beachwear collections.

She also has a collaboration with Lanc\u00f4me. Counting 24.9 million followers, Ferragni also continues to have several advertising deals ranging from Pantene to Pomellato. In April, she joined the board of Tod\u2019s. Ferragni has become so influential that when she joined the board of Tod\u2019s, the group\u2019s shares soared on the Italian stock exchange, as did Safilo\u2019s.\n\n17. Chantal Gaemperle\r\n Group Executive Vice President, Human Resources and Synergies, LVMH Mo\u00ebt Hennessy Louis Vuitton\n\nPower Move: Chantal Gaemperle has held the top human resources role at LVMH since 2007, and is renowned for nurturing internal talent and employee engagement. She is one of only two women on LVMH\u2019s executive committee, alongside Delphine Arnault. Part of her remit has been to improve gender diversity in leadership roles at the company \u2014 when she joined LVMH, women held only 23 percent of its leadership positions; that ratio stood at 42 percent last year. Through the EllesVMH network, set up in 2007, she has been instrumental in supporting women\u2019s career development. This June, she helped implement a global employee support fund, driven by what she described as an era that calls for \u201csoft-skills leadership.\u201d\r\nLeadership Advice: \u201cAs the saying goes: \u2018Be yourself, everybody else is taken!\u2019 Being authentic and staying true to your values is what allows you to fight for your convictions. It is an essential aspect of leadership, one that I deeply believe in and encourage everybody to apply.\u201d\n\n18. Michelle Gass\r\n Chief Executive Officer, Kohl\u2019s\n\nPower Move: Michelle Gass has been a game-changer, recasting the merchandise mix at Kohl\u2019s to concentrate on beauty, activewear, casual and outdoor apparel. Sephora launched on kohls.com in August, in about 200 brick-and-mortar doors this fall, and ultimately is expected to be inside 850 Kohl\u2019s locations. Kohl\u2019s active business has more than doubled in the last five years, and the goal is for the category to represent 30 percent of the retailer\u2019s volume in the future by leaning heavily on Nike, Adidas, Under Armour and the FLX private brand for growth. In outdoor and casual apparel, the offering is focused on brands like Columbia, Lands\u2019 End, and the private Sonoma brand.\r\nLeadership Advice: \u201cFor me, leadership is having the courage to lead with empathy and vulnerability. People want to work for leaders they believe in and that they can relate to. Leadership is also about anticipating tomorrow. We are operating in the most dynamic time in retail which demands a completely new way of thinking, a new level of agility and an appetite for bold, disruptive innovation.\u201d\n\n19. Evans Hankey\r\nVice President of Industrial Design, Apple\n\nPower Move: Evans Hankey is vice president of Industrial Design at Apple, leading the renowned team that designs Apple\u2019s product lineup. Evans joined Apple 21 years ago and has played a critical role in bringing some of the world\u2019s most beloved consumer products to life, including iPod, iPhone, iMac, MacBook, Apple Watch, and AirPods. With a deep understanding of processes and materials and a passion for collaboration across Apple, Evans supports and facilitates every stage of the design process working closely with the team of designers, engineers, prototypers, researchers, digital sculptors and model makers responsible for Apple\u2019s iconic designs.\r\nLeadership Advice: \u201cMany of us at Apple have had the great fortune to learn from Jony Ive and Steve Jobs, two of the most visionary leaders of our time. Foundational lessons for me have been about focus and humility. If we can maintain a tenacious focus on the work, the principles that drive the work, and the people who come together to make it happen, the rest sorts itself out. Doing so creates a culture of curiosity, trust and care, where ambition is not about personal ego but rather a force that unites us to make the very best products possible.\u201d\n\n20. Gabriela Hearst\r\n Founder, Gabriela Hearst; Creative Director, Chlo\u00e9\n\nPower Move: Gabriela Hearst\u2019s brand of female-first polish and gaucho earthiness is leading the movement toward intelligent, sustainable luxury. Using deadstock fabric and recycled cashmeres, staging carbon neutral runway shows, and collaborating with indigenous artisans, she\u2019s committed to making fashion eco-minded and purposeful. Hearst was named creative director of Chlo\u00e9 at the end of last year, and her first collections have received rave reviews. She dressed Gillian Anderson in the French brand for the 2021 Met Gala and the 2021 Emmy Awards, and has relaunched the Chlo\u00e9 Edith bag to much fanfare.\r\nLeadership Advice: \u201cIn the beginning of my career in the schmatta business, I was carrying a lot of shoe samples up the stairs to show a vendor. He said to me, \u2018You will make it because you have perseverance. But once you make it, don\u2019t believe the hype.\u2019 That always stays with me to remember to focus on the work and the effort. Perseverance for me in some ways is more important than talent.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnother quote I recently heard from a woman I admire tremendously, Isabella Tree, who is a leader in our movement. I asked her, \u2018How do you deal with ecological anxiety?\u2019 She gave me a quote I loved by Aldo Leopold, an American author and environmentalist, who said, \u2018One of the penalties of an ecological education is one lives alone in a world of wounds.\u2019 That stayed with me. I know the work is difficult, but we must plow ahead.\u201d\n\n21. Helena Helmersson\r\n Chief Executive Officer, H&M Group\n\nPower Move: Helena Helmersson entered the limelight in January last year, when she was named CEO of the fast-fashion giant. Just a couple of months into her tenure, she was charged with steering the Swedish firm, in the midst of a massive business overhaul, through pandemic-related closures and supply chain challenges. After more than 20 years working her way up the corporate ladder in purchasing roles, then as sustainability manager for the company, she is determined that fashion can play a positive role for change, and her background in corporate social responsibility is seen as key to helping the Swedish fast-fashion giant navigate the shift toward a more sustainable, circular model. Her nomination represented a major shift for the firm; she took over from Karl-Johan Persson, whose family founded the company, who was at its helm for a decade.\r\nLeadership Advice: \u201cTo me, leadership comes hand in hand with believing in people and the amazing things we can achieve when we unleash everyone\u2019s potential, become creative together and move toward a joint direction. Empowering people is deeply rooted in our culture and values, and I see this as a shared responsibility which sparks creativity and faster decisions. That, linked to being open to constant feedback to be able to develop, is what helps us as leaders to create value and growth.\u201d\n\n22. Lauren Hobart\r\n President & CEO, Dick\u2019s Sporting Goods Inc.\n\nPower Move: As the first female CEO of a major sporting goods retailer, Lauren Hobart is leading the charge at Dick\u2019s at a time when the company is firing on all cylinders, thanks to its athletic and outdoor prowess, major digital growth, new retail concepts and focus on female empowerment initiatives.\r\nLeadership Advice: \u201cI\u2019m a big believer in open communications, and leading with honest dialogue and transparency. It\u2019s so important to connect with our teammates and make sure they are included and engaged. I\u2019m incredibly grateful to our team at Dick\u2019s Sporting Goods for their openness in return. Our people are what make us great, and we win because of them.\u201d\n\n23. Fran Horowitz\r\n Chief Executive Officer, Abercrombie & Fitch Co.\n\nPower Move: As CEO, Fran Horowitz has executed an impressive, multiyear turnaround of Abercrombie & Fitch. Among the maneuvers: aggressive rationalization of the store fleet by reducing the flagship count, increasing the count on smaller stores, which are designed to be more productive, less costly and omnicapable unlike the flagships; sharpening the identity of the brands in the portfolio so they\u2019re more distinct and with less merchandise redundancy; accelerating social media where A&F has become a leader on TikTok and Instagram, and recasting the marketing so it\u2019s more inclusive, diverse and tasteful.\n\n24. Jane Hertzmark Hudis\r\n Executive Group President, The Est\u00e9e Lauder Companies\n\nPower Move: The first female executive group president in Lauder\u2019s history, Jane Hertzmark Hudis oversees a powerhouse group of brands including Est\u00e9e Lauder and La Mer, the leaders in the global sales locomotive that is the skin care category. But it\u2019s her vision for championing women, whether signing Amanda Gorman as global changemaker for Lauder or co-creating the company\u2019s Women\u2019s Leadership Network, that has earned her superstar status inside \u2014 and outside \u2014 of Lauder HQ.\r\nLeadership Advice: \u201cPursue a career in an industry that you are passionate about. If you love what you do, you are more likely to succeed. It\u2019s also important to find a mentor, one that you deeply trust who can guide you and be a sounding board as you grow and develop professionally. And remember that as you rise in your career, help lift others alongside you. The mark of a great leader is how they empower others.\u201d\n\n25.

Currently, she is executive vice president of apparel and private brands at Walmart U.S., a role she was promoted to in February. In this position, she is in charge of the mass merchant\u2019s apparel offerings in stores and online. She also oversees all private label brands across the entire general merchandise assortment, including in such categories as entertainment, toys, seasonal, home and hardlines. During her tenure at Walmart, which began in late 2017, Incandela has successfully increased the big-box retailer\u2019s apparel presence and e-commerce capabilities, adding Bonobos and Eloquii to the online assortment. The retail executive\u2019s r\u00e9sum\u00e9 also includes leadership positions at Saks Fifth Avenue, Ralph Lauren and Aerosoles.

Nordstrom, Bloomingdale\u2019s, Macy\u2019s, Hudson\u2019s Bay, Gap, Banana Republic, Sephora, and Crate & Barrel are among those that have taken the pledge. \u201cIt\u2019s about asking what kind of economic support they can pledge to help some of these businesses develop,\u201d she told WWD.\r\nLeadership Advice: \u201cListen and learn from those around you. Every day I\u2019m listening to my team and other Black small business owners, learning how I can best show up, offer resources, and help move our mission forward.\u201d\n\n27. Stella Jean Designer, Activist\n\nPower Move: A vocal advocate for Black designers in the Italian fashion industry, Stella Jean has promoted inclusivity and diversity as part of her namesake clothing brand since 2011, including creating collections collaboratively with indigenous communities. After joining the Black Lives Matter protests in Italy, Jean founded We Are Made in Italy with Michelle Ngonmo and Edward Buchanan. Working to eliminate racial and cultural discrimination in fashion, WAMI launched the \u201cWe Are Made in Italy\u201d presentation, in its third iteration this season, to bring African-born, Italian design talents to the Milan Fashion Week runways.\r\nLeadership Advice: \u201cFashion is a tool of transmitting information; let\u2019s not forget the power that it holds, power that reaches far beyond aesthetics. We must also remember that power and responsibility are two ways of expressing the same concept. It is now time for us to make our very best effort to transform what has been wielded as a supremacist tool for propaganda for too long into one of education and counter-colonization.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd I would add to all independent designers: Do not allow yourselves to be intimidated and don\u2019t be afraid. This revolution started from the bottom, exactly as all the revolutions that changed the world\u2026forever.\u201d\n\n28. Aya Kanai\r\n Head of Content and Creator Partnerships, Pinterest\n\nPower Move: Aya Kanai is head of content and creator partnerships at Pinterest and was previously editor in chief of the U.S. edition of Marie Claire magazine. Before her appointment at Marie Claire, Kanai has been Hearst Magazines\u2019 chief fashion director since 2016, overseeing the fashion content for Cosmopolitan, Women\u2019s Health, Seventeen and more.\r\nLeadership Advice: \u201cIt is important to stay curious and always ask questions no matter how senior you become. Share what you may not know and where you think your team\u2019s expertise can fill in those gaps. No one knows it all and that\u2019s exactly how it should be.\u201d\n\n29. Rei Kawakubo Creative Director, Commes des Gar\u00e7ons; Cofounder, Dover Street Market\n\nPower Move: Since 1973, Rei Kawakubo has been one of the most influential designers of our era. She continues to propel the industry forward through her multiple fashion labels, as well as Dover Street Market stores, which she uses to also introduce new talent to the industry.\n\n30. Alex Keith\r\n Chief Executive Officer, P&G Beauty\n\nPower Move: Occupying the top spot at P&G Beauty, Alex Keith is currently the only female chief executive officer at a top 10 beauty company. It is a position well-earned. During her tenure, Keith has re-energized P&G\u2019s once-bloated beauty business and restored significant growth \u2014 the CPG giant was the only top five player to post a sales increase in 2020. She\u2019s also transforming the way it does business, overseeing the creation of the Responsible Beauty platform and catapulting P&G to a leadership position in sustainability initiatives.\r\nLeadership Advice: \u201cMy advice for emerging leaders is pretty straight-forward: Know what you want, make it known to key leaders and mentors, and be flexible on the path to get there. Each experience brings with it the opportunity to learn and grow, so every stepping stone on your path to your dream job is a chance to better yourself as a practitioner and leader, regardless of what that stepping stone is. When I look back on my assignments, leading our North American Fabric Care business was not part of my plan, but it ended up being an outstanding experience that has informed my thinking and leadership ever since.\u201d\n\n31. Lin Li\r\n Founder and Creative Director, JNBY\r\nPower Move: In 1994, Hangzhou native Lin Li founded the fashion label JNBY.

It comes with an art museum, a boutique hotel, a concept store and China\u2019s first Tsutaya Books store. Li is a lover of art and architecture. She sees fashion as a miniature version of architecture, and she has been a patron at high-profile art institutions like UCCA Beijing.\n\n32. Natalie Massenet\r\n Entrepreneur and Investor; Founder, Net-a-porter; Cofounder, Imaginary Ventures\n\nPower Move: Natalie Massenet pioneered fashion e-commerce with Net-a-porter.\r\nLeadership Advice: \u201cSurround yourself with the best and smartest people, and paint a picture of what success looks like to help your team dream big, and to execute into the right direction. Also paint a picture of failure, so that they know what not to do.\u201d\n\n33. Stella McCartney \r\n Founder and Designer, Stella McCartney; special adviser to LVMH Mo\u00ebt Hennessy Louis Vuitton chairman and chief executive officer Bernard Arnault, and the executive committee members\n\nPower Move: Stella McCartney refused to work with fur and animal products even when it wasn\u2019t fashionable, and has supported mills, suppliers and manufacturers in developing sustainable materials and processes.\r\nLeadership Advice: \u201cI am incredibly honored to be recognized in this year\u2019s \u201950 Most Powerful Women\u2019 alongside so many talented and inspiring female leaders. Frankly, this group is proof that we don\u2019t just deserve a seat at the table \u2014 we should be sitting at the head of it. Since Day One with my own brand, I have believed that change requires less talk and more action. I am too accustomed to being the only woman in the room, and I know I am not alone in that.\n\nAs leaders, we must commit to putting this next generation of women\u2019s needs first \u2014 especially as we go into an uncertain future. Globally, 5 percent of women lost their jobs because of COVID-19 compared to just 3.9 percent of men, costing us $800 billion. The jobs women work often offer low wages, few benefits and no security \u2013 all while they are expected to care for children. These factors also mean women are also disproportionately impacted by the climate crisis and, while we did not create this problem, I believe our female perspectives are essential to its solution.\n\nWomen are equipped with the strength, compassion and connection to Mother Earth today to protect our better tomorrow. As a mum to both boys and girls, I want them to live in a world where they are treated equally. To get there, we must take action now \u2014 together.\u201d\n\n34. Dame Pat McGrath\r\n Makeup Artist and Founder, Pat McGrath Labs\n\nPower Move: Pat McGrath\u2019s creativity is unrivaled. Universally acknowledged to be the best makeup artist in the world, McGrath is also one of the most business-savvy. After spending the early part of her career advising on product development for the likes of Giorgio Armani (the foundation formulas she developed over a decade ago are still bestsellers,) McGrath struck out on her own with an eponymous line that has rewritten the rules of makeup and social media. And as the superlative-loving entrepreneur would say, there is nothing more major than that.\r\nLeadership Advice: \u201cWhenever someone asks me how to \u2018make it\u2019 in the fashion and beauty industry, I always tell them to never take anything personally, to work as hard as you possibly can, and never let anyone \u2014 or anything \u2014 stand in the way of your dreams. I am so fortunate that I\u2019ve spent the last three decades creating products and images that inspire others to unleash their own artistry and manifest their inner beauty on the outside. I always try to remember that my purpose on this earth is to brighten people\u2019s days, create joy, and make it just a little more beautiful. What ultimately keeps me going is the hope that what I\u2019m doing inspires beauty that dares, and emboldens someone to discover their own creativity. Creativity is your best makeup skill, don\u2019t be afraid to experiment.\u201d\n\n35. Virginie Morgon\r\n Chief Executive Officer, Eurazeo\n\nPower Move: One of very few women leaders in the still very masculine world of finance, Virginie Morgon has played a key role in accelerating investment firm Eurazeo\u2019s diversification and growth since she joined its executive board in 2008, before being named chief executive officer in March 2018. Prior to that, she spent 16 years as an investment banker at Lazard, becoming its youngest managing senior partner in Paris in 2001. She is also vice chairman at Moncler \u2014 whose rise she helped to chart and where she stayed on after Eurazeo exited the brand in 2019, generating total proceeds of 1.4 billion euros from its investment \u2014 as well as an independent board member at L\u2019Or\u00e9al. An advocate for diversity in leadership, she is a founding member of the Women\u2019s Forum for Economy and Society, and is also co-chair of the Paris Committee for Human Rights Watch.\r\nLeadership Advice: \u201cWe have the right to take risks by innovating, by making mistakes, by starting over, without fearing to fail in order to succeed.\u201d\n\n36. Amina Muaddi\r\n Founder, Designer and CEO, Amina Muaddi\n\nPower Move: Amina Muaddi is unstoppable. Even as the pandemic crippled sales of high heels for many key brands, the designer\u2019s distinctive styles continued to resonate strongly, even while people stayed at home. And though she counts many celebrities as fans, there\u2019s no one more loyal right now than Rihanna, who wore Muaddis\u2019 shoes before, during and after the Met Gala last week.\r\nLeadership Advice: \u201cTrue leadership has a lot to do with being an inspiring force with a vision that motivates and mentors without necessarily being intimidating. Showing emotion, vulnerability and being honest makes those around you support and appreciate you even harder. When you genuinely love your team and work to create a better environment for them and not just for yourself, they will love you back and will give you their 100 percent every day with passion and commitment. It\u2019s OK not to be in control of everything. You can go through hardship and face many challenges, but make it a point that you won\u2019t give up or allow anyone else to tell you what your limits are or what you can become.\u201d\n\n37. Heidi O\u2019Neill\r\n President, Consumer and Marketplace, Nike Inc.\n\nPower Move: Heidi O\u2019Neill oversees more than $40 billion in revenue and is responsible for Nike\u2019s Direct business, including all stores, e-commerce and apps globally. She also leads the Nike brand\u2019s four geographic operating regions \u2014 and more than 40,000 employees globally.\r\nLeadership Advice: \u201cAuthentic leadership isn\u2019t a medal stand \u2014 it\u2019s about moving away from the org chart and working directly within the team. It\u2019s about knowing yourself \u2014 your voice, beliefs, values, strengths, and blind spots \u2014 and then tapping into the collective power of your team.\u201d\n\n38. Minjee Park In-house Stylist, YG Entertainment\r\nPower Move: Minjee Park is the official in-house stylist at YG Entertainment where she spearheads looks for some of K-pop\u2019s biggest acts. Her largest focus in recent years has been on Blackpink, seen as the world\u2019s most famous girl group. Blackpink is known for its cutting-edge fashion, which is entirely overseen by Park \u2014 who took over duties from K-pop\u2019s other mega stylist Kyoung Won Choi circa 2018. In dressing Blackpink members Jennie, Jisoo, Lisa and Ros\u00e9, Park acts as something of a fashion power broker \u2014 helping negotiate visual identities for each girl, along with their major luxury ambassador contracts for brands like Chanel, Celine and Dior. But it\u2019s not only the big brands that Park has her eyes on. The stylist has a quick finger on the pulse \u2014 dressing Blackpink\u2019s members in an assortment of up-and-coming brands in between their major fashion house obligations. Dressing the girls in looks by Charles Jeffrey Loverboy, Vaquera and Khaite, among others, continues to help move a crucial needle for independent labels.\n\n39. Anne Pitcher\r\n Managing Director, Selfridges Group\n\nPower Move: Anne Pitcher has redefined department store retail for a digital, experiential and environmentally aware age.\r\nLeadership Advice: \u201cLeading Selfridges Group is about creating joyful experiences for our customers, teams and our local communities. Never has that felt more important, so I am looking forward to building a sustainable future for our teams, our customers and for our business.\u201d\n\n40. Miuccia Prada Co-Chief Executive Officer and Co-Creative Director, Prada\n\nPower Move: Miuccia Prada has long been considered one of the most intellectual and influential designers in the fashion industry, but her scope has extended to the arts. Setting up the Fondazione Prada with her husband and co-CEO Patrizio Bertelli, she has helped fuel the cultural conversation in Milan and in the foundation\u2019s site in Venice, attracting artists from around the world. She designs to the beat of her own drum, with a distinct aesthetic, while audaciously experimenting with new concepts every season. Prada enjoys the company of her artistic friends, many also hailing from the world of architecture and design, and she was so confident and open-minded that she had no qualms about tapping Raf Simons in 2020 as co-creative director of the Prada brand, saying that she felt the need to reinforce the creativity in her company.\n\n41. Rihanna\r\n Founder and Chief Executive Officer, Fenty Beauty\n\nPower Move: Her Instagram handle may be Badgalriri, but when it comes to matters of fashion, beauty (and music, of course), Rihanna can do no wrong. After creating a foundation revolution, Fenty Beauty continues to break new ground in beauty, most recently introducing skin care. Fashion-wise, the megastar paused her luxury maison with LVMH last year, all the better to focus on her Savage x Fenty lingerie, backed with $115 million in new funding from a panoply of investors including L Catterton, Jay-Z\u2019s Marcy Venture Partners and Sunley House Capital, part of Advent International.\n\n42. Holli Rogers\r\n Chair, Browns; Chief Brand Officer, Farfetch\n\nPower Move: Holli Rogers has married digital with physical retail as head of Browns, and continues to bring them closer together.\r\nLeadership Advice: \u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s one piece of advice, but more a mind-set and approach. I\u2019m a big believer in the power of curiosity \u2014 the more curious you are, the more you learn \u2014 about the business or industry you\u2019re in, about your customer and importantly, about the people who you work with. Curiosity is about openness \u2014 to people and new ideas, to change \u2013 and seeing it as exciting rather than scary \u2014 to sharing your values and aligning with others, and about knowing you don\u2019t have to be an expert in everything \u2014 you can always learn more.\u201d\n\n43. Julie Sari\u00f1ana\n\nInfluencer; Founder, Color Dept.\n\nPower Move: One of the original fashion bloggers, Julie Sari\u00f1ana has amassed more than 6 million followers on Instagram. She has parlayed her social media prowess into a fashion label, collaborations with companies such as Bandier and, most recently, a vegan nail polish brand, Color Dept.\n\nLeadership Advice: \u201cLeadership is believing that you have the power to inspire, create change, and have a positive impact on others. It\u2019s about trusting your instincts, and believing in yourself through the small victories, as well as the milestones. Trust your vision, and continue to believe in your story.\u201d\n\n44. Elizabeth Spaulding\r\nChief Executive Officer, Stitch Fix\n\nPower Move: Elizabeth Spaulding joined Stitch Fix as president in 2020 to focus on driving the next phase of the company\u2019s growth, including direct buy capabilities and international expansion efforts. Prior to Stitch Fix, Spaulding was global head and founder of the Digital Practice at Bain & Company, where she was a partner and served on the board. During her tenure at Bain, she supported clients in digital transformations, with a particular focus on consumer and technology sectors, and led the firm\u2019s efforts to continually evolve and grow new capabilities through partnerships and M&A. She additionally supported Bain\u2019s pro bono and social impact efforts, a passion she brings to Stitch Fix.\r\nLeadership Advice: \u201cStay focused on the possibilities and vision of the future. There will be highs and lows, but try to enjoy the journey you\u2019re on with the people you\u2019re on it with. If your optimism is running low, find ways to re-energize yourself. For me, that\u2019s spending more time with the team \u2014 visiting our warehouses, talking to our stylists and learning from our tech team members fills me with appreciation and renewed energy, and reminds me that great ideas and innovation are happening in every corner of our business.\u201d\n\n45. Diane Sullivan\r\n Chairman and CEO, Caleres Inc.\n\nPower Move: As the longtime force at the center of Caleres Inc., Diane Sullivan has built a roster of diverse brands from Sam Edelman to Allen Edmonds to Vionic \u2014 and she continues to bolster the 60-year-old Famous Footwear chain. The family retailer drove Caleres\u2019 explosive growth in the second quarter as the chain saw its highest level of Q2 sales in its history, at about $454 million.\r\nLeadership Advice: \u201cDon\u2019t think about what you want to change, but think about where you want to go.\u201d\n\n46. Sonia Syngal\n\nChief Executive Officer, Gap Inc.\n\nPower Move: Since March 2020, Sonia Syngal has led the $16 million business across all geographies and channels overseeing a team of nearly 130,000 employees. She was hired to lead the company into its next chapter. A dynamic leader, Syngal is known for leading with both vision and heart and is an excellent operator who drives innovation and decisive action.\n\nLeadership Advice: \u201cIt\u2019s important to eliminate the noise, get rid of the clutter, and avoid getting caught in the headlines. I focus my energy on the possibilities based on the trendline data.\u201d\n\n47. Virginie Viard\n\nCreative Director, Chanel\n\nPower Move: Virginie Viard has continued the legacies of Gabrielle Chanel and Karl Lagerfeld by reimagining the label\u2019s classic take on women\u2019s wear. She has brought the works of female artists and artisans, as well as a youthful and feminine spirit, to the forefront.\n\n48. Karla Welch Stylist; Founder, Period; Cofounder, Wishi\n\nPower Move: In her nearly 20 years as a stylist, Karla Welch has worked her magic on Hollywood celebrities, Olympic athletes and politicos. At the Met Gala alone, she styled Justin Bieber, Hailey Bieber, Rose from Blackpink, Lorde, Ava DuVernay, Naomi Osaka, Karlie Kloss, Tracee Ellis Ross and Megan Rapinoe. An in-demand collaborator, she\u2019s been tapped by Levi\u2019s, Express and Eddie Bauer, among others, and has made her political voice part of her personal brand.\r\nLeadership Advice: \u201cYou can\u2019t do it all. Build a team.\u201d\n\n49. Kim Kardashian West Founder, Skims, KKW Beauty\n\nPower Move: The latest launch in a career of entertainment and entrepreneurial pursuits, Kim Kardashian West\u2019s inclusive lingerie brand Skims has been a runaway success, racking up $145 million in revenue in 2020 and forecasted to exceed $300 million in 2021. In April, Skims raised $154 million in a Series A funding round from venture capital group Thrive to fuel growth, after receiving a valuation of $1.6 billion. Part of the brand\u2019s success is fueled by Kardashian West\u2019s social media presence; she speaks to 255 million on Instagram and can still shut down a red carpet, as she did at the 2021 Met Gala with her Balenciaga blackout head-to-toe T-shirt look.\r\nLeadership Advice: \u201cTrust your instincts. This is such a key component of all decisions for me \u2014 I always evaluate the pros and cons of a situation, but at the end of the day my intuition is the north star.\u201d\n\n50. Wendy Yang\r\n President, Performance Lifestyle Group, Deckers Brands\n\nPower Move: Few athletic brands have seen growth like Hoka One One, where Wendy Yang and her team are eyeing $1 billion in sales. They\u2019re well on their way: Hoka\u2019s overall Q2 revenue increased 95 percent to $213.1 million, and the fast-growing running brand accounted for nearly 40 percent of parent company Deckers\u2019 total revenue.\r\nLeadership Advice: \u201cHire great people and believe in yourself. We have a great team, and we\u2019re growing super fast, [so effective leading] comes down to communication, consistency, discipline and empathy. Those things have never been as important as they are now.\u201d",
